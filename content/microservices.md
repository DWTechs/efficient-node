title: What is the Microservices architecture
---

Microservices architecture refers to an architectural style for developing applications.
It allows a large application to be separated into small independent parts, with each part having its own realm of responsibility. 
To serve a single user request, a microservices-based application can call on many internal microservices to compose its response.

Containers are a well-suited microservices architecture example, since they let you focus on developing the services without worrying about the dependencies. Modern cloud-native applications are usually built as microservices using containers.

A microservices architecture is a type of application architecture where the application is developed as a collection of services. It provides the framework to develop, deploy, and maintain microservices architecture diagrams and services independently.

Within a microservices architecture, each microservice is a single service built to accommodate an application feature and handle discrete tasks. Each microservice communicates with other services through simple interfaces to solve business problems.

Microservices are used to speed up application development. 
It is common to compare microservices versus service-oriented architecture. Both have the same objective, which is to break up monolithic applications into smaller components, but they have different approaches.

Microservices architecture is the the most popular architecture for web development.
Node.js with its very small footprint is extremely well suited for this type of architecture.
