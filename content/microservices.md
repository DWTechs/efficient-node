title: What is the Microservices architecture
---

Microservices architecture refers to an architectural style for developing applications where the application is developed as a collection of services.
It allows a large application to be separated into small independent services. Each one having its own realm of responsibility, built to accommodate an application feature and handle discrete tasks.
It is very well suited for cloud-based applications. Modern cloud-native applications are usually built as microservices using containers.

To serve a single user request, a microservices-based application can call on many internal microservices to compose its response.

Microservices are used to speed up development. 
It is common to compare microservices versus service-oriented architecture. Both have the same objective of breaking up monolithic applications into smaller components, but with different approaches.

Node.js with its very small footprint is very well suited for this type of architecture.
